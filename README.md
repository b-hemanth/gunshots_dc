## Authors: Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy and Ilkin Bayramli
_This project aims to investigate the gunshot data provided by the Justice Tech Lab on Washington DC._ 

## The App
https://hemanth-bharatha-chakravarthy.shinyapps.io/gunshots_wash_dc/

## Note on the Data
The Justice Tech Lab's ShotSpotter uses acoustic sensors to detect gunfire sounds and record time as well as location of all gunfire incidents in a covered area.


The dataset we use covers Washington DC for the years 2006-2017. Check out the full ShotSpotter data here http://justicetechlab.org/shotspotter-data/.

## Note on our Project
We decided to use this data to investigate gunshot locations across months of different years and through the hours of any given day. We built this geospatial analysis using Shiny to be interactive and animated to better inform you, the user.
